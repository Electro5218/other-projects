# üìÇ Other Projects

This repository is a collection of **side projects, experiments, and educational exercises**. These projects were created for learning, practice, or experimentation purposes and are not directly tied to my core security portfolio. They demonstrate my exploration of different programming concepts, automation tasks, scripting, and general software development skills.

## üìå Purpose

This repository serves as a **sandbox for learning and experimentation**. While these projects are not directly relevant to security-focused roles, they showcase my ability to:

- Learn and experiment with new technologies  
- Write clean, functional code in multiple languages  
- Understand programming concepts and problem-solving techniques

‚úÖ This is part of my GitHub portfolio, separated from my **main security projects** to keep the focus on core skills for SOC, Security Engineer, Pentester, and Security Analyst roles.
